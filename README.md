## Installation

*Reminders MenuBar requires macOS Big Sur 11 or later.*

### Homebrew

Reminders MenuBar can be installed using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).

```bash
brew install --cask reminders-menubar
```

### Direct Download

Direct downloads can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/DamascenoRafael/reminders-menubar/releases).  
After downloading and extracting, just drag the *.app* file to the *Applications* folder.

## Permission Request

Reminders MenuBar uses [EKEventStore](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit/ekeventstore) to access reminders on macOS (which are available in Apple Reminders and can be synced through iCloud). On first use, the app should request permission to access reminders as shown below.

    alt="macOS window asking permission for Reminders MenuBar to access reminders"

</div>

In *System Settings > Privacy & Security > Reminders* it is possible to manage this permission.

### OpenCore Legacy Patcher

If you are using *OpenCore Legacy Patcher* it is possible that you are not being able to grant access permission to reminders and therefore you are facing a window saying *"Access to Reminders is not enabled for Reminders MenuBar"*.

  <summary>
  Click here if you are using <i>OpenCore Legacy Patcher</i>
  </summary>

This issue is related to *OpenCore Legacy Patcher* as stated in the official documentation:  
[OpenCore Legacy Patcher | Unable to grant special permissions to apps](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher/ACCEL.html#unable-to-grant-special-permissions-to-apps-ie-camera-access-to-zoom)

A workaround is to use TCCPlus to add this permission. I would suggest looking up some threads on the subject and if possible making a backup before trying commands that might affect the use of macOS.

I cannot guarantee that TCCPlus still works or if it's reliable for new versions of macOS. The workaround below was tested by other users on issue [#159](https://github.com/DamascenoRafael/reminders-menubar/issues/159), but if you decide to proceed it is at your own risk.

After downloading and extracting [TCCPlus](https://github.com/jslegendre/tccplus) in the *Downloads* folder, open the *Terminal* and run the following commands:

```shell
cd ~/Downloads/
chmod +x tccplus
./tccplus add Reminders br.com.damascenorafael.reminders-menubar
```
